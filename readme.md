# R Applications and Digit Recognition Project

This repository contains **5 simple R applications** and a **mini project** for **digit recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.

## Applications

1. **Voting among Three Groups**: A Shiny app where users can vote between three groups.
2. **Employee Voting**: Employees can vote for one option and provide a reason. The analysis is visualized through graphs.
3. **Scatter Plot**: A simple scatter plot for various units.
4. **Histogram Plot**: A histogram plot displaying data for various units.
5. **Dataset Analyzer**: An app that allows users to upload datasets, analyze them, and plot graphs.

## Mini Project: Digit Recognition with CNN
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for recognizing handwritten digits, utilizing datasets like MNIST for training and prediction.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lokeshj2403/R.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary R packages:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2", "keras", "tensorflow"))
   ```

## Usage

- **Run the Shiny applications**: Use the `shiny::runApp()` function to launch each app (`app1.R`, `app2.R`, etc.).
  
- **Digit Recognition Model**: After installing Keras and TensorFlow, run the CNN script for training and digit recognition.
